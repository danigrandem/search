# Movie & TV Show Project

This project leverages the production API from [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/) to provide up-to-date movie and TV show information.

## Features

- **Production TMDb API:** Uses the official TMDb production API for all data requests.
- **API Key Management:**
  - Obtain your TMDb API key from [https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api).

  - The API key is **not** included in the repository for security and realism.
  - If you prefer, you can request Camila's API key directly.
